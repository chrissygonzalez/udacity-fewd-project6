# Feed Reader Testing

This project uses [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) to test an example feed reader app's functionality.


## How to review this project

1. Download the project files.
2. Open index.html in a web browser.
3. There should be 10 tests shown at the bottom of the page. The first 7 should pass, and the last 3 should fail, as they test future functionality that isn't yet implemented in the app.
4. The feed reader should function properly and load 4 feeds, available in the hidden side menu that should open and close when the hamburger icon is clicked.

## Resources used
Besides the Javascript Testing videos provided for the class, I referenced [Jasmine's online documentation](http://jasmine.github.io/2.0/introduction.html) and the Udacity discussion forums to write the tests in this project. I did try Googling for answers, but I was surprised not to have success with any of the articles I found. Either I wasn't able to find the appropriate search terms, or there just isn't a lot of information available about testing asynchronous functions with this version of Jasmine (the problem I spent most of the time on).
